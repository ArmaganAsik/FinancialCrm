#### ðŸ’¬ This repo was developed as final project of the C# training camp organized by Murat Yucedag via YouTube. Below are the technical details. 
The project was developed on the Windows Forms platform and uses Entity Framework for data access, with a Database First approach. Microsoft SQL Server was chosen for database management.  

ðŸ”Ž Dashboard Form : *This is the main entry form that provides access to all other forms. It displays the total balance, along with bills and their amounts that change every 1.5 seconds. The form also shows the most recent banking transaction. Additionally, a column chart is used to display the balance status for each bank and a pie chart shows the distribution of bill amounts (e.g., electricity, water).*

ðŸ”Ž Category Form : *This form is designed to manage categories based on expense types. Expense types such as bills, education expenses and transportation expenses can be classified using this form. It allows users to perform basic CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete).*  

ðŸ”Ž Bank Form : *This form allows users to view and update their bank balances. Additionally, users can view the last 5 bank transactions directly within the form.*  

ðŸ”Ž Bill Form : *This form allows users to view bill periods along with their amounts. Users can also perform basic CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on bills.*

ðŸ”Ž Expense Form : *This form allows users to add expenses based on category and date, as well as perform other CRUD operations. Users can filter expenses by a specific date range and/or category. Additionally, the form displays both the total expenses and the total of the filtered expenses.*

ðŸ”Ž Transaction Form : *This form allows users to view all bank transactions, including transaction types such as income and expenses. Unlike the Bank form, which only shows the last 5 transactions, this form provides a complete list of all transactions.*
